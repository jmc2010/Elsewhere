# Status

Living handoff between working sessions. Update it when something lands.
Read `CLAUDE.md` for the rules and `docs/spec.md` for the reasoning — this
file only covers **where we are right now**.

**Phase 0 — Foundation.** Exit criteria: catalog queryable by radius +
cuisine in under 200ms.

## Environment

| | |
|---|---|
| Supabase project | `https://oygsbuailwpjgkqbxllp.supabase.co` |
| PostGIS | 3.3 (`USE_GEOS=1 USE_PROJ=1 USE_STATS=1`) |
| Overture release | `2026-08-19.0` |
| First metro | **North Texas** — `-97.9 32.3 -96.1 33.75` |

Connection string lives in the developer's shell as `ELSEWHERE_PG_URL`.
It is a superuser credential — never commit it, never paste it into a chat.

The box runs Valley View down through the metroplex to Waxahachie, and
Weatherford across to Greenville. Chosen because the developer can eyeball
bad cuisine mappings in it. Size is not a cost problem: the audit surface is
the ~182 distinct categories, which barely grows with area, and bbox
predicates push down to parquet row-group stats so the whole extract takes
about nine seconds.

## Done

- Repo, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/spec.md`
- CI guard `scripts/check-no-google-persistence.py`, verified to fail on a
  violation and pass clean
- **0001 init** — applied. 16 tables, all with RLS on. (`spatial_ref_sys`
  reports RLS off; it is PostGIS's own extension-owned table, contains only
  published EPSG definitions, and cannot be altered. Expect it as a permanent
  Supabase Security Advisor warning.)
- **0002 cuisines** — applied. 15 groups, 93 leaves.
- **0003 staging** — applied. It had never been applied before 2026-09-20;
  the standing "confirm it is applied" note is now resolved.
- **0004 staging taxonomy** — applied. Adds `category_hierarchy`,
  `basic_category`, `operating_status` to `overture_staging`.
- **`extract_overture.sh` — corrected, and run against Supabase.** North Texas
  (`-97.9 32.3 -96.1 33.75`) landed **39,852 rows** in `overture_staging`:
  32,770 `open`, 6,534 null, 548 `permanently_closed`. Matched the local
  dry-run exactly. Idempotent — re-running rebuilds the box.

### Connecting to Supabase from this machine

Use the **Session pooler** string (`…pooler.supabase.com:5432`), not the
direct connection. `db.oygsbuailwpjgkqbxllp.supabase.co` resolves **AAAA
only**, and the developer's network has no IPv6 egress, so the direct string
fails with no useful error. The transaction pooler (6543) also will not work
— DuckDB's bulk insert needs session-mode transactions. The paid IPv4 add-on
is not needed; the shared pooler is already IPv4.

## Next

**Build the category → cuisine mapping, then promote.** This is the last thing
standing between here and the Phase 0 exit criteria — `places` is still empty;
everything so far is in `overture_staging`.

Start by looking at what actually landed:

```sql
select primary_category, count(*)
from overture_staging
group by 1 order by 2 desc;
```

182 distinct categories over four branches — `restaurant` (120 leaves),
`casual_eatery` (27), `alcoholic_beverage_venue` (26),
`non_alcoholic_beverage_venue` (8). The spec calls this the hardest data
problem in the project, and it is still the step to be careful about, but it
is easier than the spec assumed — **re-scope it before starting** (see below).

The shape of the work:

1. Most leaves are already cuisine-shaped (`mexican_restaurant`,
   `texmex_restaurant`, `italian_restaurant`, `barbecue_restaurant`) and map
   to the 93 seeded cuisine leaves by reviewed rename.
2. The real problem is the leaves that carry no cuisine at all —
   `restaurant` (4,602 rows), `fast_food_restaurant` (3,249),
   `casual_eatery`. Together that is a large fraction of the catalog with no
   filterable cuisine, and it needs a different signal: brand/name matching,
   `alternate_categories`, or a Claude pass over names.
3. Hand-audit the result for North Texas. The developer lives in the box, so
   bad mappings should be visible by eye.

Then write the promote step: `overture_staging` → `places`, **excluding
`operating_status = 'permanently_closed'`** (548 rows). Every closed place
that reaches the catalog is a wasted Google hydration call against a
restaurant that no longer exists.

## What changed in Overture, and why it matters

Overture now ships a **hierarchical** taxonomy (`taxonomy.primary`,
`taxonomy.hierarchy`) alongside the legacy flat `categories` struct the
original script was written against. Two consequences:

1. **The extract filter was wrong in both directions and is now exact.** The
   old `LIKE '%bar%'`-style filter matched `barber` (39 rows in one Denton
   box), `public_school`, `public_health_clinic` and
   `courier_and_delivery_services` — while *silently dropping* donut shops,
   bagel shops, gelato, cupcakes, beer gardens and a distillery, none of whose
   leaf names contain any of the 21 substrings. That is ~1,000 donut shops
   across North Texas, including Daily Donuts in Valley View. Per the README's
   own rule — over-capturing is cheap, a missed place is invisible — the false
   negatives were the serious half. The filter is now
   `hierarchy[1] = 'food_and_drink'`, with a verified `basic_category`
   fallback for the 87 rows that carry no taxonomy.

2. **The cuisine mapping got easier.** The spec assumed a flat category set
   needing a full offline Claude pass. Many leaves are already cuisine-shaped
   (`mexican_restaurant`, `texmex_restaurant`, `italian_restaurant`,
   `barbecue_restaurant`) and the hierarchy groups them. The real work is now
   the genuinely ambiguous leaves — `restaurant` (4,602 rows),
   `fast_food_restaurant` (3,249), `casual_eatery` — which carry no cuisine at
   all and need a different signal. **Re-scope the mapping task before
   starting it**; the spec's framing predates this schema.

Also new: `operating_status`. Overture flags permanently-closed places itself,
which partially pre-empts spec risk #2. They are kept in staging (inspectable)
and must be excluded at promote — every one that reaches the catalog is a
wasted Google hydration call against a restaurant that no longer exists. This
is Overture open data, **not** Google's `businessStatus`; storing it is legal
and the two are different fields.

## Open decisions

- **Apple account type.** Current developer account appears to be Individual,
  which publishes a personal legal name as the App Store seller. Either ship
  Individual and use App Transfer later, or form the entity and convert. Not
  urgent; does not block Phase 0.
- **App Store name.** "Elsewhere" alone is almost certainly taken (Elsewhere
  Dream Journal, ELSEWHERE.TO LTD). Plan of record is
  **"Elsewhere: Where to Eat"** with subtitle "Your dining concierge".
- **Trademark clearance.** ELSEWHERE.TO LTD is a real Class 9 conflict to put
  in front of an attorney before anything is published.
