-- Clamp the search radius.
--
-- catalog_search is called directly as an RPC by the app (decided
-- 2026-09-20), so every argument is attacker-controlled. p_limit was already
-- bounded because it is the Google hydration budget. p_radius_meters was not,
-- and it is the more dangerous of the two: a single call with a continental
-- radius turns the bitmap scan into a full-catalog scan. That costs database
-- time rather than Google spend, so it would not show up in the
-- calls-per-session metric at all.
--
-- 100 miles is deliberately generous. The spec's own example of an
-- exhaustive query is "every Italian place within 50 miles" (§1), so this
-- leaves a wide margin over the real product need while still bounding the
-- work per call.
--
-- This is the argument-validation an edge function would otherwise have done.
-- Putting it in the function rather than in a wrapper keeps it true no matter
-- who calls, including psql, a future edge function, or a scheduled job.
